Multiplexed imaging technologies are amongst the fastest growing areas of multi-omics. These technologies capture many parameters of single 
cells while preserving their spatial location. As such, there is a need for a flexible, robust, and easily deployed end to end computational 
pipeline for processing and analysis of the data such technologies produce. The goal of such a pipeline is to capture cell-type compositions 
in a localized shape-preserving manner. To help researchers achieve this goal, we have developed Hudson.

 Fluorescent Imaging is the visualization of fluorescent dyes or proteins as labels for molecular processes or structures. It enables a wide range of
 experimental observations including the location and dynamics of gene expression, protein expression and molecular interactions in cells and tissues.
